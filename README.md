## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code only uses Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib and was tested on a Python version 3.8.8.
There should be no necessary  other libraries to run the code here beyond these.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project was written as a part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Programm. For this project the [German House Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/scriptsultan/german-house-prices) from Kaggle is used .
The author of this dataset scraped the data from Immoscout24, a german real estate marketplaze, similar to Zillow. The data is from July 2020.
I am interested in answering the following focus questions with regard to the data:

1. What is the most common sold real estate type in Germany.
2. Which Bundesland has the highest prices.
3. Which features pose a high impact on the real estate prices


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook including markdown and code containing all the necessary executions to answer the above questions.

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the corresponding github page, available [here](https://discoluc.github.io/udacityhouseprices/).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
